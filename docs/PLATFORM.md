# Kenworthy Ticketing Platform — Operations & Handoff Guide

> **Purpose:** This document is the single source of truth for everything needed to operate, maintain, and eventually hand off the Kenworthy ticketing platform. It should be updated every time a new credential, service, or configuration is added. A future owner should be able to reconstruct the full picture from this document alone.

## 3. Environment Variables

These variables must be set in **Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment Variables**. They are never committed to the repository.

| Variable | Where to find it | Environment |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → API | Both |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → API (anon key) | Both |
| `VITE_SQUARE_APP_ID` | Square Developer Console → Credentials | Both |
| `VITE_SQUARE_ENV` | Set to `sandbox` for staging, `production` for prod | Per environment |
| `VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID` | Square Developer Console → Locations | Both |

> **Note:** Cloudflare Pages supports per-environment variables. Staging and Production can have different values for the same key — use this to keep Square sandbox credentials on staging and live credentials on production.

## 4. Deployment

### Branch strategy
| Branch | Deploys to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production URL | What the public sees. Only merge here when tested. |
| `staging` | Preview URL | Testing ground. All development work goes here first. |

### Deploy process
1. Make changes locally on a feature branch
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Run `npm run build` — must pass clean before pushing
4. Merge to `staging` → Cloudflare auto-deploys to preview URL
5. Test on the preview URL
6. Merge `staging` → `main` → Cloudflare auto-deploys to production

### Build settings (Cloudflare Pages)
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Framework preset | Vite |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |
| Node version | 20 (set via environment variable `NODE_VERSION=20`) |

---

## 5. Database

- **Platform:** Supabase (Postgres)
- **Schema migrations:** Located in `/supabase/migrations/` in the repo
- **To apply migrations:** `npx supabase db push` (requires Supabase CLI and project linked)
- **Backups:** Supabase Pro plan includes daily backups. Confirm plan level before go-live.

### Key tables
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | Extended user data (name, role) linked to Supabase auth |
| `user_roles` | Assigns `admin` or `regular_user` role to each user |
| `movies` | Film and event listings |
| `showings` | Scheduled screenings tied to a movie |
| `seats` | Seat map for assigned-seating showings |
| `bookings` | Ticket purchase records |
| `tickets` | Individual tickets with QR code UUIDs |

### Granting admin access to a new staff member
1. Have them sign up via the app at `/auth`
2. Go to Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → `user_roles`
3. Insert a row: `user_id` = their UUID (found in Authentication → Users), `role` = `admin`
4. Have them sign out and back in

## 6. Known Issues & Technical Debt

These are issues identified during the build audit. They should be resolved before go-live.

| Priority | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 High | Payment processing is simulated — no real Square integration | Not started |
| 🔴 High | No email confirmation sent after ticket purchase | Not started |
| 🟡 Medium | No race condition protection on seat booking (two users could book the same seat simultaneously) | Not started |
| 🟡 Medium | Tax rate hardcoded as Idaho 6% — confirm correct jurisdiction | Needs client confirmation |
| 🟡 Medium | Seat map not tied to specific venue/room — single global pool | Not started |
| 🟢 Low | `lovable-tagger` dev dependency is a Lovable-specific residual | Low risk; harmless in production |
| 🟢 Low | Only two roles (`admin`, `regular_user`) — no `staff` role for box office without full admin | Not started |
